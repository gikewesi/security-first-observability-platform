# Security-First Observability Platform

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive security-focused observability platform. It highlights expertise in Kubernetes, monitoring, alerting, compliance, and infrastructure-as-code—key skills for a DevOps or Cloud engineer.

---

## **Problem**

Maintaining security, compliance, and operational visibility in cloud-native environments is challenging:

* **Limited visibility:** Difficult to monitor cluster and application performance across multiple services.
* **Delayed detection:** Security incidents or policy violations can go unnoticed.
* **Manual configuration:** Deploying monitoring and security tools manually is error-prone and inconsistent.
* **Compliance gaps:** Sensitive data and security policies are often not enforced uniformly.

These challenges increase risk, slow down incident response, and create potential compliance violations.

---

## **Solution**

This project implements a **security-first observability platform** that addresses these challenges:

* **Monitoring & metrics:** Prometheus collects cluster and application metrics.
* **Visualization:** Grafana dashboards provide actionable insights for performance and security.
* **Log aggregation:** Loki consolidates Kubernetes and AWS logs, including CloudWatch and EKS logs.
* **Runtime security & policy enforcement:** Falco or Kyverno detects anomalous activity and enforces policies.
* **Alerting:** Alertmanager integrated with Slack or SNS sends real-time notifications for security incidents.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform automates provisioning and configuration for all tools.
* **Data security:** Optional KMS encryption for sensitive logs and secrets.

## **Architecture**

```
 ├─ monitoring/         # Prometheus, Grafana, Loki setup
 ├─ security/           # Falco or Kyverno policies
 ├─ logs/               # CloudWatch + EKS log collection
 └─ alerts/             # Alertmanager + SNS/Slack integration
 └─ terraform/             
```

**Workflow:**

1. Terraform provisions the observability and security infrastructure.
2. Prometheus and Grafana collect and visualize metrics.
3. Loki aggregates logs from Kubernetes and AWS services.
4. Falco or Kyverno enforces security policies and detects anomalies.
5. Alertmanager sends real-time alerts for incidents to Slack or SNS.

---

## **Key Features**

* Full-stack observability with metrics, logs, and dashboards.
* Runtime security and policy enforcement for Kubernetes workloads.
* Automated alerting for security incidents and operational issues.
* Infrastructure as Code with Terraform for repeatable deployments.
* Optional encryption with AWS KMS for sensitive data.
* Demonstrates CI/CD and GitOps practices with automated deployments.

---

## **Getting Started**

**1. Provision infrastructure:**

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**2. Deploy monitoring stack:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring/
```

**3. Deploy security policies:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f security/
```

**4. Configure log collection and alerting:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f logs/
kubectl apply -f alerts/
```

**5. Access dashboards:**

* Grafana: `http://<grafana-url>`
* Prometheus: `http://<prometheus-url>`

**6. Test alerts:**
Trigger a sample policy violation or metric threshold to confirm Slack/SNS notifications.

---

## **Outcome**

* Centralized, secure observability platform for Kubernetes and cloud workloads.
* Real-time alerting for policy violations and operational issues.
* Demonstrates hands-on expertise in Kubernetes security, monitoring, compliance, IaC, and CI/CD best practices.
* Ready for production-level deployment in multi-tenant cloud environments.
